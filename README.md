# Reinforcement Learning
This repository explores deep reinforcement learning through projects. The project uses OpenAI gym environments an pytorch primarly.

In the first project, we implement PPO for the discrete Cart Pole System. A GAE advtange estimate is used throughout along with deep neural networks for computing value estimates and policy. Throughout training a plot of the system's episode durations is displayed at each iteration. The user can terminate this at any time to visualize the policy in the "human" render mode.
